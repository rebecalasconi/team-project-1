                            <p>Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they can digest solid food. Early-lactation milk, called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system.</p>

When eaten as part of a nutrient-dense diet, these nuts may offer benefits such as reducing your risk of heart disease. They’re a good source of fiber, healthy fats, and plant protein. Plus, they’re great on their own.</p>

                        <p>Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of the best ways to gain an understanding of this type of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter.</p>
