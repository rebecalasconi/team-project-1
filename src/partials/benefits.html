It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they can digest solid food. Early-lactation milk, called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system.</p>

When eaten as part of a nutrient-dense diet, these nuts may offer benefits such as reducing your risk of heart disease. They’re a good source of fiber, healthy fats, and plant protein. Plus, they’re great on their own.</p>

Semi-sweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste, whereas milk chocolate is sweeter.</p>
